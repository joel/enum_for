### Security

There are several concerns when using AR Enum with API, when you receive a payload it is hard to handle a proper error message.

```ruby
class Conversation < ActiveRecord::Base
  enum status: [ :draft, :active, :archived ]
end
```

```curl
curl -X POST \
  {{domain}}/api/v1/conversations \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8' \
  -d '{
    "conversation": {
      "title": "Relativity theory",
      "status": "unactive"
    }'
```

```ruby
conversation = Conversation.new
conversation.status = "unactive"
=> ArgumentError ('unactive' is not a valid status)
```

instead with `EnumFor`

```ruby
class Conversation < ActiveRecord::Base
  extend EnumFor
  enum_for status: { draft: 0, active: 1, archived: 2 }
  validates :status, inclusion: statuses.keys
end
```

```curl
curl -X POST \
  {{domain}}/api/v1/conversations \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8' \
  -d '{
    "conversation": {
      "title": "Relativity theory",
      "status": "unactive"
    }'
```

```ruby
conversation = Conversation.new
conversation.status = "unactive"
conversation.valid?
=> false 
conversation.errors.messages
=> { status: [ 'is not included in the list' ] }
```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'enum_for'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install enum_for

## Usage

You need to extend the AR class you want to use it:

```ruby
class Conversation < ActiveRecord::Base
  extend EnumFor
  enum_for status: { draft: 0, active: 1, archived: 2 }
  validates :status, inclusion: statuses.keys
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
